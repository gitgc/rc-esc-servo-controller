# RC ESC Servo Controller

This project is a simple RC ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) and steering servo controller using an ESP32.

Note, this project borrows heavily from the [https://github.com/RB-ENantel/RC_ESC](https://github.com/RB-ENantel/RC_ESC) which provides ESC functionality for the Arduino platform.
